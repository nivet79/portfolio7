            <p>
                Whether you have been counting macronutrients or “macros” for a while or are getting started, at some point you may find yourself without a food scale, meal plan template or tracking app and you will find the need to guesstimate how much food to put on your plate. Or maybe you just want the fastest way possible to balance your portions and stay on track.

                The portion plate you use may change from day to day or from meal to meal, depending on your nutrition goals. You can adjust your proteins and carbs based on how active you will be that day, eating more food when you are more active and a lighter meal when you are less active.


                <br><br>
                Carbohydrate needs are directly related to your level of physical activity. Eat more carbohydrates when you are the most active.

Protein needs are directly related to lean body mass. You should get at least 1g of protein per 1 pound of lean body mass. Structuring your meals to fill 1/4th to 1/3rd of your plate with high quality protein will give you about 30-40 grams per meal, and enough to meet your needs.

The type of activity you are doing can also affect your macro needs. Heavy lifting and high intensity training will require more carbs and a little more protein, compared to moderate activity when you might not need to adjust your carbs at all.
